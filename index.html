                <h3>The Great Ruins </h3>
                <p>Long ago before humans existed,there was a great war that broke out <br>
                   among gods and gods of gods each gods supporting his master with each of them <br>
                   possesing different powers and mystical strength whose explanation is beyond the unknown <br>
                   who won? lol i guess that is rhetorical it ended in a great disater of which the ruins is known as the<br> <span style="color:aqua; font-size:50px;">RUINS OF GODS</span>
                   the war lasted 1000 years before a treaty was made to create a far lesser <br>being called human which to whom will be assigned to each gods to be called his worshippers<br>
